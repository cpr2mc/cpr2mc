- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Chris Roos, @cpr2mc.
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in learning programming, problem solving, and team building.
- :zap: I recently completed a Full Stack Web Development bootcamp through PDX Code Guild based out of Portland, Oregon. For my final project, I deployed a full stack web application utilizing an API I built with Django REST Framework, Vue.JS for the front-end, Axios for the data call, and Bootstrap for the styling and CSS.
- ðŸŒ± I plan on completing an additional 10 projects utilizing Vue.JS, Django, and DRF to build my portfolio and explore different concepts.
